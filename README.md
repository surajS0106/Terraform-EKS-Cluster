Welcome to the repository for **Configuring Production-Ready EKS Clusters with Terraform and Automating with GitHub Actions**! This repository accompanies my blog post and demonstrates the practical steps to set up and automate an EKS cluster.

## ðŸŒŸ Overview
This project covers:
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: Use Terraform to define and manage your EKS cluster.
- **CI/CD Automation**: Leverage GitHub Actions to automate deployments.

## ðŸŒŸ Comprehensive Guide
For a detailed guide, please refer to my [blog post on Medium](https://medium.com/p/c046e8d44865).

Note : I have cloned this repo from Aman Pathak as he has publicly shared this project and using it for my personal project. A huge shoutout to him for making this and all credits go to him!
